# Notes from class! 

- Rendering is a mathematical heavy process, might not be your part of programming!
- Smaller companies are typically more generalist. In AAA it's important to find your niche!
- In your future internship you might get a feel of where you fit in?
- Auxilliary layers = Audio, Networking, Collision & Phyisics, AI... Typically runs on separate threads
- Foundation layer = (What were gonna focus on) - High Level Game Flow / States, Events, Game objects management, scripting system, world loading / streaming

## Game Object Management

- Inheritance based? Actor->Mario
- Component based? Actors have lists of components
- Not Object Oriented? Entity component systems / ECS

## Scripting system
- Look into LUA to integreate an existing scripting language
- Compilation or JIT can be leverages for speeds
- Visual Representations of scripting systems (like blueprint)
- Bespoke scripting languages (GDScript etc..)
-
